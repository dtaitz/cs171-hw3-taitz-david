# Problem 1 

1. Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area.

* The HTML element type is a rect. There are two classes for the rect that are associated with the rects. These are "extent" and "background". The "background" represents the interactive area or the total area, which the brush tool can be used.

2. Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection.

* The HTML element type is a class. The type that is used to represent the selection is "extent". This is the region of the background rect that is highlighted.


3. What are the other DOM elements for?

* The other DOM elements allow the user to change the size of the selection. "class: resize-e" lets you adjust the selection in the east direction and "class resize-w" lets you adjust the selection in the west direciton.
