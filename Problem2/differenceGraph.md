# Design Studio- Difference Graph

*For my difference graph, I decided to draw a line that represents the average estimate of each of the census and also include the min and max values in different colors for each year. I believed that this would help understand both absolute and relative differences. The absolute change is shown because the viewer can use the y-scale to know the difference between the mean line and the value. The relative change is shown because the y-scale is not based on the min/max values of the differences but rather the min/max values of the population estimates. This shows that allow one could potentially read the absolute difference through the y-scale, the relative immensity of the population size show that these differences are insignificant.


*If I had more time, I intended on making a relative graph that showed (max - min)/(min) for every year. I was able to format my data into an actionable form, but was unable to actually make a radio button that would switch between forms. The reasoning behind these designs was to show absolute difference was rather insignificant compared to the size of the numbers. The relative scale would show that the estimates were only a relatively small percent difference from one another. The absolute changes may seem significant if the y-scale was adjused for min and max difference instead of total number of people, while the relative change would seem rather small.
